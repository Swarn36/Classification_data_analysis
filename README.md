Welcome to the Classification_data_analysis repository! This project serves as a comprehensive collection of my work and learning progress on classification problems. One can explore various classification models from this repository.
Introduction
In the world of machine learning, classification problems are ubiquitous. From predicting customer churn to identifying spam emails, effective classification models are essential. This repository consolidates my work on diverse classification tasks.

Models Included
The repository covers a wide range of classification models, including:

Logistic Regression: A fundamental linear model for binary classification.
Random Forest: A versatile ensemble method for both classification and regression.
Gradient Boosting: Boosted decision trees for improved predictive performance.
Decision Tree: A simple yet powerful tree-based model for classification.
PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Dimensionality reduction technique often used as a preprocessing step for classification.
KMeans: Unsupervised learning algorithm commonly used for clustering, but adaptable for classification tasks.
...and more! Each model is implemented with clarity and is accompanied by explanatory documentation.

As my learning path will discover more models in this category, I will try my best to input those along with these.
